Created Ruby substring method using I've learned so far.
The method accepts a word as first argument and an array as second argument. The result will return a hash listing found in th original string and number of times it's found.
Used each method for the second argument(array), while splitting to array the first argument and using each method. Used conditional statement to know if each string include each array.
